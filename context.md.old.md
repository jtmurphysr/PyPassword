# Password Manager Development Context

## Overview
We've been working on a password manager application with a GUI interface built using Tkinter. The application includes features for:
- Secure password storage with encryption
- Master password protection
- Password generation
- Search functionality
- Clipboard operations

## Recent Work (Morning Session)
We've been focusing on improving the test suite for the application, particularly addressing issues with GUI elements appearing during testing.

### Key Issues Encountered
1. GUI Windows Appearing During Tests
   - Setup window showing up during test execution
   - Login window appearing unexpectedly
   - Message boxes displaying during test runs

### Attempted Solutions
1. Added test_mode parameter to PasswordManager
   - Initialized GUI components as Mock objects in test mode
   - Set up test data and encryption in test mode
   - Prevented actual GUI operations in test mode

2. Modified Test Fixtures
   - Created temporary directories for test files
   - Patched file paths to use temporary locations
   - Set up mock Tkinter widgets
   - Configured mock entry widgets with test data

3. Updated Test File Structure
   - Moved file path patching to before PasswordManager import
   - Created test files at import time
   - Simplified test fixtures
   - Added proper mocking for GUI components

### Current Status
- Still encountering issues with GUI windows appearing during tests
- Need to investigate alternative approaches to GUI testing
- May need to reconsider the application's architecture for better testability

### Next Steps
1. Review test setup from scratch
2. Consider alternative testing approaches
3. Research best practices for GUI testing
4. Evaluate potential architectural changes
5. Consider using a testing framework specifically designed for GUI applications

## Technical Details
- Built with Python and Tkinter
- Uses Fernet encryption for password storage
- Implements bcrypt for password hashing
- Includes clipboard functionality for password copying
- Features password generation with configurable requirements
